# rpi23-gen-image
## Introduction
`rpi23-gen-image.sh` is an advanced Debian Linux bootstrapping shell script for generating Debian OS images for all Raspberry Pi computers. The script at this time supports the bootstrapping of the Debian (armhf/armel) releases `stretch` and `buster`. Raspberry Pi 0/1/2/3 images are generated for 32-bit mode only. Raspberry Pi 3 supports 64-bit images that can be generated using custom configuration parameters (```templates/rpi3-stretch-arm64-4.14.y```).



## Build dependencies
The following list of Debian packages must be installed on the build system because they are essentially required for the bootstrapping process. The script will check if all required packages are installed and missing packages will be installed automatically if confirmed by the user.

  ```debootstrap debian-archive-keyring qemu-user-static binfmt-support dosfstools rsync bmap-tools whois git bc psmisc dbus sudo```

It is recommended to configure the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script to build and install the latest Raspberry Pi Linux kernel. For the Raspberry 3 this is mandatory. Kernel compilation and linking will be performed on the build system using an ARM (armhf/armel) cross-compiler toolchain.

The script has been tested using the default `crossbuild-essential-armhf` and `crossbuild-essential-armel` toolchain meta packages on Debian Linux `stretch` build systems. Please check the [Debian CrossToolchains Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/CrossToolchains) for further information.

## Command-line parameters
The script accepts certain command-line parameters to enable or disable specific OS features, services and configuration settings. These parameters are passed to the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script via (simple) shell-variables. Unlike environment shell-variables (simple) shell-variables are defined at the beginning of the command-line call of the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script.

##### Command-line examples:
```shell
ENABLE_UBOOT=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_CONSOLE=false ENABLE_IPV6=false ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_WM=xfce4 ENABLE_FBTURBO=true ENABLE_MINBASE=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_HARDNET=true ENABLE_IPTABLES=true /rpi23-gen-image.sh
APT_SERVER=ftp.de.debian.org APT_PROXY="http://127.0.0.1:3142/" ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_MINBASE=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
BUILD_KERNEL=true ENABLE_MINBASE=true ENABLE_IPV6=false ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
BUILD_KERNEL=true KERNELSRC_DIR=/tmp/linux ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_MINBASE=true ENABLE_REDUCE=true ENABLE_MINGPU=true BUILD_KERNEL=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_CRYPTFS=true CRYPTFS_PASSWORD=changeme EXPANDROOT=false ENABLE_MINBASE=true ENABLE_REDUCE=true ENABLE_MINGPU=true BUILD_KERNEL=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
RELEASE=stretch BUILD_KERNEL=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
RPI_MODEL=3 ENABLE_WIRELESS=true ENABLE_MINBASE=true BUILD_KERNEL=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
RELEASE=stretch RPI_MODEL=3 ENABLE_WIRELESS=true ENABLE_MINBASE=true BUILD_KERNEL=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
```

## Configuration template files
To avoid long lists of command-line parameters and to help to store the favourite parameter configurations the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script supports so called configuration template files (`CONFIG_TEMPLATE`=template). These are simple text files located in the `./templates` directory that contain the list of configuration parameters that will be used. New configuration template files can be added to the `./templates` directory.

##### Command-line examples:
```shell
CONFIG_TEMPLATE=rpi3stretch ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
CONFIG_TEMPLATE=rpi2stretch ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
```

## Supported parameters and settings
#### APT settings:
##### `APT_SERVER`="ftp.debian.org"
Set Debian packages server address. Choose a server from the list of Debian worldwide [mirror sites](https://www.debian.org/mirror/list). Using a nearby server will probably speed-up all required downloads within the bootstrapping process.

##### `APT_PROXY`=""
Set Proxy server address. Using a local Proxy-Cache like `apt-cacher-ng` will speed-up the bootstrapping process because all required Debian packages will only be downloaded from the Debian mirror site once. If `apt-cacher-ng` is running on default `http://127.0.0.1:3142` it is autodetected and you don't need to set this.

##### `APT_INCLUDES`=""
A comma-separated list of additional packages to be installed by debootstrap during bootstrapping.

##### `APT_INCLUDES_LATE`=""
A comma-separated list of additional packages to be installed by apt after bootstrapping and after APT sources are set up.  This is useful for packages with pre-depends, which debootstrap do not handle well.

---

#### General system settings:
##### `SET_ARCH`=32
Set Architecture to default 32bit. If you want to compile 64-bit (RPI3 or RPI3+) set it to `64`. This option will set every needed cross-compiler or board specific option for a successful build.

##### `RPI_MODEL`=2
Specify the target Raspberry Pi hardware model. The script at this time supports the following Raspberry Pi models:
- `0`  = Raspberry Pi 0 and Raspberry Pi 0 W

---

#### Basic system features:
##### `ENABLE_CONSOLE`=true
Enable serial console interface. Recommended if no monitor or keyboard is connected to the RPi2/3. In case of problems fe. if the network (auto) configuration failed - the serial console can be used to access the system. On RPI `0` `3` `3P` the CPU speed is locked at lowest speed.

##### `ENABLE_PRINTK`=false
Enables printing kernel messages to konsole. printk is `3 4 1 3` as in raspbian.

##### `ENABLE_BLUETOOTH`=false
Enable onboard Bluetooth interface on the RPi0/3/3P. See: [Configuring the GPIO serial port on Raspbian jessie and stretch](https://spellfoundry.com/2016/05/29/configuring-gpio-serial-port-raspbian-jessie-including-pi-3/).

##### `ENABLE_MINIUART_OVERLAY`=false
Enable Bluetooth to use this. Adds overlay to swap UART0 with UART1. Enabling (slower) Bluetooth and full speed serial console. - RPI `0` `3` `3P` have a fast `hardware UART0` (ttyAMA0) and a `mini UART1` (ttyS0)! RPI `1` `1P` `2` only have a `hardware UART0`. `UART0` is considered better, because is faster and more stable than `mini UART1`. By default the Bluetooth modem is mapped to the `hardware UART0` and `mini UART` is used for console. The `mini UART` is a problem for the serial console, because its baudrate depends on the CPU frequency, which is changing on runtime. Resulting in a volatile baudrate and thus in an unusable serial console.
 
##### `ENABLE_TURBO`=false
Enable Turbo mode. This setting locks cpu at the highest frequency. As setting ENABLE_CONSOLE=true locks RPI to lowest CPU speed, this is can be used additionally to lock cpu hat max speed. Need a good power supply and probably cooling for the Raspberry PI.

##### `ENABLE_I2C`=false
Enable I2C interface on the RPi 0/1/2/3. Please check the [RPi 0/1/2/3 pinout diagrams](https://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals) to connect the right GPIO pins.

##### `ENABLE_SPI`=false
Enable SPI interface on the RPi 0/1/2/3. Please check the [RPi 0/1/2/3 pinout diagrams](https://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals) to connect the right GPIO pins.

##### `ENABLE_IPV6`=true
Enable IPv6 support. The network interface configuration is managed via systemd-networkd.

##### `ENABLE_SSHD`=true
Install and enable OpenSSH service. The default configuration of the service doesn't allow `root` to login. Please use the user `pi` instead and `su -` or `sudo` to execute commands as root.

##### `ENABLE_NONFREE`=false
Allow the installation of non-free Debian packages that do not comply with the DFSG. This is required to install closed-source firmware binary blobs.

##### `ENABLE_WIRELESS`=false
Download and install the [closed-source firmware binary blob](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/firmware-nonfree/raw/master/brcm) that is required to run the internal wireless interface of the Raspberry Pi model `3`. This parameter is ignored if the specified `RPI_MODEL` is not `3`.

##### `ENABLE_RSYSLOG`=true
If set to false, disable and uninstall rsyslog (so logs will be available only in journal files)

##### `ENABLE_SOUND`=true
Enable sound hardware and install Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.

##### `ENABLE_HWRANDOM`=true
Enable Hardware Random Number Generator. Strong random numbers are important for most network-based communications that use encryption. It's recommended to be enabled.

##### `ENABLE_MINGPU`=false
Minimize the amount of shared memory reserved for the GPU. It doesn't seem to be possible to fully disable the GPU.

##### `ENABLE_DBUS`=true
Install and enable D-Bus message bus. Please note that systemd should work without D-bus but it's recommended to be enabled.

##### `ENABLE_XORG`=false
Install Xorg open-source X Window System.

##### `ENABLE_WM`=""
Install a user-defined window manager for the X Window System. To make sure all X related package dependencies are getting installed `ENABLE_XORG` will automatically get enabled if `ENABLE_WM` is used. The `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script has been tested with the following list of window managers: `blackbox`, `openbox`, `fluxbox`, `jwm`, `dwm`, `xfce4`, `awesome`.

##### `ENABLE_SYSVINIT`=false
Support for halt,init,poweroff,reboot,runlevel,shutdown,telinit commands

## Understanding the script
The functions of this script that are required for the different stages of the bootstrapping are split up into single files located inside the `bootstrap.d` directory. During the bootstrapping every script in this directory gets executed in lexicographical order:

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `10-bootstrap.sh` | Debootstrap basic system |
| `11-apt.sh` | Setup APT repositories |
| `12-locale.sh` | Setup Locales and keyboard settings |
| `13-kernel.sh` | Build and install RPi 0/1/2/3 Kernel |
| `14-fstab.sh` | Setup fstab and initramfs |
| `15-rpi-config.sh` | Setup RPi 0/1/2/3 config and cmdline |
| `20-networking.sh` | Setup Networking |
| `21-firewall.sh` | Setup Firewall |
| `30-security.sh` | Setup Users and Security settings |
| `31-logging.sh` | Setup Logging |
| `32-sshd.sh` | Setup SSH and public keys |
| `41-uboot.sh` | Build and Setup U-Boot |
| `42-fbturbo.sh` | Build and Setup fbturbo Xorg driver |
| `43-videocore.sh` | Build and Setup videocore libraries |
| `50-firstboot.sh` | First boot actions |
| `99-reduce.sh` | Reduce the disk space usage |

All the required configuration files that will be copied to the generated OS image are located inside the `files` directory. It is not recommended to modify these configuration files manually.

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `apt` | APT management configuration files |
| `boot` | Boot and RPi 0/1/2/3 configuration files |
| `dpkg` | Package Manager configuration |
| `etc` | Configuration files and rc scripts |
| `firstboot` | Scripts that get executed on first boot  |
| `initramfs` | Initramfs scripts |
| `iptables` | Firewall configuration files |
| `locales` | Locales configuration |
| `modules` | Kernel Modules configuration |
| `mount` | Fstab configuration |
| `network` | Networking configuration files |
| `sysctl.d` | Swapping and Network Hardening configuration |
| `xorg` | fbturbo Xorg driver configuration |

## Custom packages and scripts
Debian custom packages, i.e. those not in the debian repositories, can be installed by placing them in the `packages` directory. They are installed immediately after packages from the repositories are installed. Any dependencies listed in the custom packages will be downloaded automatically from the repositories. Do not list these custom packages in `APT_INCLUDES`.

Scripts in the custom.d directory will be executed after all other installation is complete but before the image is created.

## Logging of the bootstrapping process
All information related to the bootstrapping process and the commands executed by the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script can easily be saved into a logfile. The common shell command `script` can be used for this purpose:

```shell
script -c 'APT_SERVER=ftp.de.debian.org ./rpi23-gen-image.sh' ./build.log
```

## Flashing the image file
After the image file was successfully created by the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script it can be copied to the microSD card that will be used by the RPi 0/1/2/3 computer. This can be performed by using the tools `bmaptool` or `dd`. Using `bmaptool` will probably speed-up the copy process because `bmaptool` copies more wisely than `dd`.

##### Flashing examples:
```shell
bmaptool copy ./images/buster/2017-01-23-rpi3-buster.img /dev/mmcblk0
dd bs=4M if=./images/buster/2017-01-23-rpi3-buster.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
```
If you have set `ENABLE_SPLITFS`, copy the `-frmw` image on the microSD card, then the `-root` one on the USB drive:
```shell
bmaptool copy ./images/buster/2017-01-23-rpi3-buster-frmw.img /dev/mmcblk0
bmaptool copy ./images/buster/2017-01-23-rpi3-buster-root.img /dev/sdc
```

## QEMU emulation
Start QEMU full system emulation:
```shell
qemu-system-arm -m 2048M -M vexpress-a15 -cpu cortex-a15 -kernel kernel7.img -no-reboot -dtb vexpress-v2p-ca15_a7.dtb -sd ${IMAGE_NAME}.qcow2 -append "root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootfstype=ext4 console=tty1"
```

Start QEMU full system emulation and output to console:
```shell
qemu-system-arm -m 2048M -M vexpress-a15 -cpu cortex-a15 -kernel kernel7.img -no-reboot -dtb vexpress-v2p-ca15_a7.dtb -sd ${IMAGE_NAME}.qcow2 -append "root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootfstype=ext4 console=ttyAMA0,115200 init=/bin/systemd" -serial stdio
```

Start QEMU full system emulation with SMP and output to console:
```shell
qemu-system-arm -m 2048M -M vexpress-a15 -cpu cortex-a15 -smp cpus=2,maxcpus=2 -kernel kernel7.img -no-reboot -dtb vexpress-v2p-ca15_a7.dtb -sd ${IMAGE_NAME}.qcow2 -append "root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootfstype=ext4 console=ttyAMA0,115200 init=/bin/systemd" -serial stdio
```
