# rpi23-gen-image
## Introduction

`rpi23-gen-image.sh` is an advanced Debian Linux bootstrapping shell script for generating Debian OS images for Raspberry Pi 2 (RPi2) and Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3) computers. The script at this time supports the bootstrapping of the Debian (armhf) releases `jessie`, `stretch` and `buster`. Raspberry Pi 3 images are generated for 32-bit mode only. Raspberry Pi 3 64-bit images can be generated using custom configuration parameters (```templates/rpi3-stretch-arm64-4.11.y```).


## Build dependencies
The following list of Debian packages must be installed on the build system because they are essentially required for the bootstrapping process. The script will check if all required packages are installed and missing packages will be installed automatically if confirmed by the user.

  ```debootstrap debian-archive-keyring qemu-user-static binfmt-support dosfstools rsync bmap-tools whois git bc psmisc dbus sudo```

It is recommended to configure the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script to build and install the latest Raspberry Pi Linux kernel. For the RPi3 this is mandatory. Kernel compilation and linking will be performed on the build system using an ARM (armhf) cross-compiler toolchain.

The script has been tested using the default `crossbuild-essential-armhf` toolchain meta package on Debian Linux `jessie` and `stretch` build systems. Please check the [Debian CrossToolchains Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/CrossToolchains) for further information.

If a Debian Linux `jessie` build system is used it will be required to add the [Debian Cross-toolchains repository](http://emdebian.org/tools/debian/) first:

```
echo "deb http://emdebian.org/tools/debian/ jessie main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/crosstools.list
sudo -u nobody wget -O - http://emdebian.org/tools/debian/emdebian-toolchain-archive.key | apt-key add -
dpkg --add-architecture armhf
apt-get update
```

## Command-line parameters
The script accepts certain command-line parameters to enable or disable specific OS features, services and configuration settings. These parameters are passed to the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script via (simple) shell-variables. Unlike environment shell-variables (simple) shell-variables are defined at the beginning of the command-line call of the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script.

##### Command-line examples:
```shell
ENABLE_UBOOT=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_CONSOLE=false ENABLE_IPV6=false ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_WM=xfce4 ENABLE_FBTURBO=true ENABLE_MINBASE=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_HARDNET=true ENABLE_IPTABLES=true /rpi23-gen-image.sh
APT_SERVER=ftp.de.debian.org APT_PROXY="http://127.0.0.1:3142/" ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_MINBASE=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
BUILD_KERNEL=true ENABLE_MINBASE=true ENABLE_IPV6=false ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
BUILD_KERNEL=true KERNELSRC_DIR=/tmp/linux ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_MINBASE=true ENABLE_REDUCE=true ENABLE_MINGPU=true BUILD_KERNEL=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
ENABLE_CRYPTFS=true CRYPTFS_PASSWORD=changeme EXPANDROOT=false ENABLE_MINBASE=true ENABLE_REDUCE=true ENABLE_MINGPU=true BUILD_KERNEL=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
RELEASE=stretch BUILD_KERNEL=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
RPI_MODEL=3 ENABLE_WIRELESS=true ENABLE_MINBASE=true BUILD_KERNEL=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
RELEASE=stretch RPI_MODEL=3 ENABLE_WIRELESS=true ENABLE_MINBASE=true BUILD_KERNEL=true ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
```

## Configuration template files
To avoid long lists of command-line parameters and to help to store the favourite parameter configurations the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script supports so called configuration template files (`CONFIG_TEMPLATE`=template). These are simple text files located in the `./templates` directory that contain the list of configuration parameters that will be used. New configuration template files can be added to the `./templates` directory.

##### Command-line examples:
```shell
CONFIG_TEMPLATE=rpi3stretch ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
CONFIG_TEMPLATE=rpi2stretch ./rpi23-gen-image.sh
```

## Supported parameters and settings
#### APT settings:
##### `APT_SERVER`="ftp.debian.org"
Set Debian packages server address. Choose a server from the list of Debian worldwide [mirror sites](https://www.debian.org/mirror/list). Using a nearby server will probably speed-up all required downloads within the bootstrapping process.

##### `APT_PROXY`=""
Set Proxy server address. Using a local Proxy-Cache like `apt-cacher-ng` will speed-up the bootstrapping process because all required Debian packages will only be downloaded from the Debian mirror site once.

##### `APT_INCLUDES`=""
A comma separated list of additional packages to be installed by debootstrap during bootstrapping.

##### `APT_INCLUDES_LATE`=""
A comma separated list of additional packages to be installed by apt after bootstrapping and after APT sources are set up.  This is useful for packages with pre-depends, which debootstrap do not handle well.

---

#### General system settings:
##### `RPI_MODEL`=2

##### `KERNEL_REDUCE`=false
Reduce the size of the generated kernel by removing unwanted device, network and filesystem drivers (experimental).

##### `KERNEL_THREADS`=1

## Understanding the script
The functions of this script that are required for the different stages of the bootstrapping are split up into single files located inside the `bootstrap.d` directory. During the bootstrapping every script in this directory gets executed in lexicographical order:

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `10-bootstrap.sh` | Debootstrap basic system |
| `11-apt.sh` | Setup APT repositories |
| `12-locale.sh` | Setup Locales and keyboard settings |
| `13-kernel.sh` | Build and install RPi2/3 Kernel |
| `14-fstab.sh` | Setup fstab and initramfs |
| `15-rpi-config.sh` | Setup RPi2/3 config and cmdline |
| `20-networking.sh` | Setup Networking |
| `21-firewall.sh` | Setup Firewall |
| `30-security.sh` | Setup Users and Security settings |
| `31-logging.sh` | Setup Logging |
| `32-sshd.sh` | Setup SSH and public keys |
| `41-uboot.sh` | Build and Setup U-Boot |
| `42-fbturbo.sh` | Build and Setup fbturbo Xorg driver |
| `50-firstboot.sh` | First boot actions |
| `99-reduce.sh` | Reduce the disk space usage |

All the required configuration files that will be copied to the generated OS image are located inside the `files` directory. It is not recommended to modify these configuration files manually.

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `apt` | APT management configuration files |
| `boot` | Boot and RPi2/3 configuration files |
| `dpkg` | Package Manager configuration |
| `etc` | Configuration files and rc scripts |
| `firstboot` | Scripts that get executed on first boot  |
| `initramfs` | Initramfs scripts |
| `iptables` | Firewall configuration files |
| `locales` | Locales configuration |
| `modules` | Kernel Modules configuration |
| `mount` | Fstab configuration |
| `network` | Networking configuration files |
| `sysctl.d` | Swapping and Network Hardening configuration |
| `xorg` | fbturbo Xorg driver configuration |

## Custom packages and scripts
Debian custom packages, i.e. those not in the debian repositories, can be installed by placing them in the `packages` directory. They are installed immediately after packages from the repositories are installed. Any dependencies listed in the custom packages will be downloaded automatically from the repositories. Do not list these custom packages in `APT_INCLUDES`.

Scripts in the custom.d directory will be executed after all other installation is complete but before the image is created.

## Logging of the bootstrapping process
All information related to the bootstrapping process and the commands executed by the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script can easily be saved into a logfile. The common shell command `script` can be used for this purpose:

```shell
script -c 'APT_SERVER=ftp.de.debian.org ./rpi23-gen-image.sh' ./build.log
```

## Flashing the image file
After the image file was successfully created by the `rpi23-gen-image.sh` script it can be copied to the microSD card that will be used by the RPi2/3 computer. This can be performed by using the tools `bmaptool` or `dd`. Using `bmaptool` will probably speed-up the copy process because `bmaptool` copies more wisely than `dd`.

##### Flashing examples:
```shell
bmaptool copy ./images/jessie/2017-01-23-rpi3-jessie.img /dev/mmcblk0
dd bs=4M if=./images/jessie/2017-01-23-rpi3-jessie.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
```
If you have set `ENABLE_SPLITFS`, copy the `-frmw` image on the microSD card, then the `-root` one on the USB drive:
```shell
bmaptool copy ./images/jessie/2017-01-23-rpi3-jessie-frmw.img /dev/mmcblk0
bmaptool copy ./images/jessie/2017-01-23-rpi3-jessie-root.img /dev/sdc
```
