## Templates used at IFÃ‰ ENS de Lyon for Tremplin project

These templates have been used to create Raspberry Pi images for the project "Climate and meteorolgy springboard for teaching sciences". These images  are used as explained in the [blog](http://blog.climatetmeteo.fr/GerardVidal/) (mostly in french).

The aim was to share with teachers an image providing software resources to use commercial weatherstations or DIY weathersystems made with various sensors.  The following images have been built :

 * raspife2-stretch Debian stretch image for raspi 2
 * raspife3-jessie Debian jessie image for raspi 3
 * raspife3-stretch Debian stretch image for raspi 3
 * raspife3W-stretch Debian stretch image for raspi 3 with single IPAddress and weewx service
 * raspife3-buster Debian buster image for raspi 3
