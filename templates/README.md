## Templates used at IFÃ‰ ENS de Lyon for "Tremplin des sciences" project

These templates have been used to create Raspberry Pi images for the
project "Climate and meteorolgy springboard for teaching sciences".
These images  are tuned andused as explained in the
[blog](http://blog.climatetmeteo.fr/GerardVidal/) (mostly in french
but under translation).

The aim is to share with teachers a Raspberry Pi3 binary image providing software resources to use commercial weatherstations or DIY weathersystems made with various sensors.  The following images have been built :

 * raspife2-stretch Debian stretch image for raspi 2
 * raspife3-jessie Debian jessie image for raspi 3
 * raspife3-stretch Debian stretch image for raspi 3
 * raspife3W-stretch Debian stretch image for raspi 3 with single IPAddress and weewx service
 * raspife3-buster Debian buster image for raspi 3
 
In these images language ichoosen is french and can easily be changed.
Pathes and other variables are the ones that have been used during
execution and personnal data are replaced by "*******", change the
values according to your needs.
